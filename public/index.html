  <h1>Innovation & Creativity</h1>
  <p class="subtitle">
    In this project, we focused heavily on the concept and creativity behind The Community Wall. 
    We wanted to use blockchain technology in a meaningful way, so we built a system that lets anyone upload an image and mint it as an NFT. 
    Each uploaded image becomes a permanent tile on the Community Wall. 
    It is owned by the creator and preserved forever on the blockchain. 
    Our goal is to give people a place to share their art, interests, and differences while bringing everyone together through a digitalized community wall.
